# Measuring bias in (deep) convolutional neural networks
## _Using Colored MNIST and celebA datasets_

## Implementations

- CelebA color splitter (splits the color channels for a given dataset i.e celebA)
- MNIST bias detection
- CelebA training on RGB channels
- CelebA training on individual channels
